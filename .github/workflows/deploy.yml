jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build-and-deploy"
  build-and-deploy:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Grant permissions for the job to write to the gh-pages branch
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 1. Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up Node.js in the runner
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20 # You can change this to your project's Node.js version

      # 3. Installs project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # 4. Runs the build script (npm run build)
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
        # If your build script creates the 'dist' folder in a different location,
        # you might need to adjust the 'path' in the upload step below.
        # If your Vite config has a 'base' path (e.g., /my-repo/), ensure it's set correctly.

      # 5. Configure GitHub Pages
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5

      # 6. Upload the build output (the 'dist' folder) as an artifact
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          # This should be the directory your build script outputs to
          path: './dist' 

      # 7. Deploy the artifact to GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
